# A Practical Guide to Making the World Better

Small, consistent actions compound over time. Here are concrete things you can do — sorted by the time they take.

---

## Takes 30 Seconds

- Tell someone what you genuinely appreciate about them. Be specific.
- Leave a thoughtful review for a small local business that deserves it.
- Donate your old tab on [tab for a cause](https://tab.gladly.io) (every new browser tab shows an ad, proceeds fund charity).
- Text someone you haven't talked to in a while, just to say you thought of them.
- Compliment someone's work publicly (a comment on a post, a reply to a newsletter, a kind email).

## Takes 5 Minutes

- Register as an organ donor if you aren't already.
- Call your representative about an issue you care about. They count calls.
- Write an honest, kind review for a book or tool that helped you.
- Donate to a cause you believe in — even a small recurring amount adds up.
- Forward an article or resource that changed how you think about something.

## Takes an Hour

- Volunteer your professional skills: edit someone's resume, review someone's code, proofread a grant application.
- Participate in a local community cleanup.
- Mentor someone earlier in their career. One honest conversation can change a trajectory.
- Give blood. One donation can save up to three lives.
- Cook extra food and bring it to a neighbor, shelter, or food bank.

## Takes Ongoing Commitment

- Plant something — a tree, a garden bed, a window box of pollinator flowers.
- Join or support a local mutual aid network.
- Learn basic first aid and CPR. Most emergencies happen around people who could help but don't know how.
- Reduce food waste: plan meals, learn to use scraps, compost what's left.
- Show up consistently for the people in your life who are struggling.

## A Note on Burnout

You can't pour from an empty cup. Taking care of yourself isn't a detour from helping others — it's a prerequisite. Rest, boundaries, and joy make sustained contribution possible.

The world doesn't need your occasional heroics. It needs your steady, ordinary, compounding kindness.
