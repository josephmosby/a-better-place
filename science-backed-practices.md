# Science-Backed Practices for Well-Being

Research from UC Berkeley's [Greater Good Science Center](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/) shows that well-being isn't luck — it's a set of skills you can practice. Here are evidence-based actions, organized by the science behind them.

## Gratitude

Robert Emmons' research shows gratitude has two components: affirming that good things exist, and recognizing their sources are outside ourselves. Gratitude strengthens relationships because it forces us to see how we've been supported by others.

**Try this:**
- **Keep a gratitude journal.** Write three specific things you're grateful for each week. Studies show this increases happiness and reduces depression after just 10 weeks.
- **Write a gratitude letter.** Pick someone who changed your life and write them a detailed letter about what they did and how it affected you. Deliver it in person if you can.
- **Say thanks at work.** Only 10% of people express gratitude to colleagues on any given day, even though 93% say grateful leaders are more successful. Be in the 10%.
- **Thank someone for doing their job.** The barista, the janitor, the IT person. Especially the people whose work is invisible when done well.

## Social Connection

Humans are wired to connect — our brains process social pleasure the same way they process physical pleasure. Research shows that the quality of our social ties is one of the strongest predictors of happiness and longevity.

**Try this:**
- **Have one real conversation a day.** Not small talk — ask someone what they're working on, struggling with, or excited about. Listen.
- **Put your phone away when someone is talking to you.** Full attention is now a radical act of kindness.
- **Eat with someone.** Shared meals are one of the oldest forms of human bonding. Invite a coworker, neighbor, or friend you haven't seen in a while.
- **Check on someone who's been quiet.** The people who stop reaching out are often the ones who need connection most.

## Forgiveness

Holding grudges doesn't punish the other person — it punishes you. Research shows that forgiveness reduces anxiety, depression, and physical health problems. It doesn't mean condoning harm; it means releasing its grip on you.

**Try this:**
- **Write about it, then let it go.** Journaling about a grudge and then consciously choosing to release it has measurable mental health benefits.
- **Practice empathy first.** Before forgiving, try to understand why the person did what they did. This doesn't excuse it — it makes forgiveness possible.
- **Forgive yourself.** Self-compassion research shows that people who forgive their own mistakes are more resilient, not less disciplined.

## Awe

Experiencing awe — that feeling of vastness that shifts your perspective — reduces stress, increases generosity, and makes people feel more connected to others. You don't need a mountaintop. Awe is available in the ordinary.

**Try this:**
- **Take an "awe walk."** Deliberately go somewhere — a park, a street with old trees, a building with interesting architecture — and pay attention to what's bigger than you.
- **Look up.** Literally. The sky, clouds, stars. We spend most of our day looking at screens at eye level or below.
- **Share something that gave you awe.** A photo, a story, a link. Awe is contagious.

## Intellectual Humility

The willingness to be wrong — and to update your beliefs when you are — is linked to better decision-making, stronger relationships, and less polarization. It's not weakness. It's how learning works.

**Try this:**
- **Say "I might be wrong about this" before stating a strong opinion.** Then actually mean it.
- **Ask "what would change my mind?"** If you can't answer that, you're not holding a belief — you're holding an identity.
- **Steelman the other side.** Before arguing against something, articulate the strongest version of the opposing view. If you can't, you don't understand it well enough.

## Active Listening

Most people listen to respond, not to understand. Research on listening shows that being truly heard activates the same neural reward pathways as receiving a gift.

**Try this:**
- **Repeat back what someone said in your own words.** "So what you're saying is..." — this alone transforms conversations.
- **Ask follow-up questions instead of pivoting to your own story.** The urge to relate is strong. Resist it.
- **Sit with silence.** When someone finishes talking, wait two seconds before responding. They'll often say the most important thing in that gap.

## A Note on Evidence

These aren't feel-good platitudes. Each practice above is backed by peer-reviewed research in psychology, neuroscience, or behavioral science. The Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley has been synthesizing this research since 2001.

The consistent finding across all of it: **the things that make you happier also make the world better.** Gratitude, connection, forgiveness, awe, humility, and listening aren't just self-help — they're how communities heal and thrive.
